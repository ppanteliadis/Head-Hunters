# HeadHunters
A MySQL implementation for the database management of a business called HeadHunters. 

This was an assignment for the Data Bases class in University of Crete, Greece.

##Compiling
For this project we are using the XAMPP tool in order to start a local MySQL  database so we are covering the basics, but feel free to load it in a real server and email us how it goes.

First of all, drop the project files in the htdocs folder created in your system by XAMPP. After that, open your web browser and navigate to localhost/phpmyadmin and under the section import, upload the database. (We have already created some dummy imports for testing purposes) 

After that is done, navigate to localhost/login.php and you are good to go!
